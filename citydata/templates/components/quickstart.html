<h2>About GeoLink</h2>
<p>Geolink allows you to create a global network and plan routes within it through air and road travel</p>

<h4>To start, add some cities to your network in the Add Cities page.</h4> 
<p>Hub cities are the centers of your network, and are all connected to eachother by air</p>
<p>Other cities can be specified to have air access or not</p>

<h4>Once you've added your cities, connect them in the Manage Connections page</h4>
<p>You can dictate a set of parameters that define how your network is connected</p>
<p>The network is then automatically generated<p>
